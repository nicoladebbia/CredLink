## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Commercial Product Path Chosen
- Committed to building production system
- 18-30 month journey to profitability
- Real customers, real revenue
- No shortcuts

### 2. Radical Transparency Commitment
- Only claim what we've measured
- Monthly honest progress updates
- Admit mistakes immediately
- No more aspirational claims as facts

### 3. Honest Timeline Established
- 6-12 months to production-ready
- Backend: 0% complete (honest assessment)
- No false completion claims
- Measured milestones only

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. Got caught up in startup exaggeration culture
2. Thought "selling the vision" justified dishonesty
3. Assumed we'd "catch up" to our claims later
4. Underestimated trust damage from false claims

### What We Fixed:
1. Created comprehensive audit process
2. Established verification infrastructure
3. Made strategic identity choice
4. Committed to radical transparency
5. Published public apology

### What We'll Do Different:
1. Measure before claiming
2. Label targets as targets
3. Never compare unfinished to shipping products
4. Publish quarterly honest progress reports
5. Build trust through demonstrated delivery
