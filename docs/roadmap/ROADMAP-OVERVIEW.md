# CredLink Roadmap

**CURRENT PLAN:** See `/MVP-ROADMAP-REALISTIC.md` (the actual execution plan)

This folder previously contained aspirational phase documentation that was **not backed by code**. All of that has been deleted.

## What's Left

We're executing the **16-week MVP roadmap** documented in `/MVP-ROADMAP-REALISTIC.md`.

**No more fictional phases. No more aspirational documents. Just executable work.**

---

## Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Weeks | Status | What Gets Done |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1: Backend Implementation** | 1-6 | Starting | Real C2PA signing, verification, proof storage |
| **Phase 2: Infrastructure & Deployment** | 5-8 | Starting | AWS infrastructure, CI/CD, production domain |
| **Phase 3: Testing & Quality** | 9-10 | Starting | 90% code coverage, performance tests, security audit |
| **Phase 4: Beta Program** | 11-16 | Starting | Get 10-20 paying customers, hit $1-5K MRR |

**Total: 16 weeks to MVP with paying customers.**

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Real C2PA signatures (not mock)
✅ Deployed to AWS (not localhost)
✅ 10+ paying customers (not zero)
✅ $1-5K MRR (not fictional numbers)
✅ 99.9% real uptime (not aspirational)

That's it. That's the plan.
