## 📞 QUESTIONS?

**Common questions:**

**Q: Can we skip Phase 1-2 and go straight to building?**  
A: No. Honesty is the foundation. Without it, everything else is built on sand.

**Q: Can we do this faster than 18-30 months?**  
A: Maybe 15-20 months if you're exceptionally disciplined and lucky. But probably not. Quality takes time.

**Q: What if we're running out of money?**  
A: Focus on Phase 1-5. Get to paying customers fast. Phases 6-10 can wait if needed.

**Q: Do we really need SOC2?**  
A: Not immediately. But for enterprise customers (Phase 8), yes.

**Q: Can we hire a contractor to speed this up?**  
A: Contractors can help with specific phases (especially Phase 3-4). But strategy and customer work (Phase 5+) needs to be internal.

**Q: What if we discover the original feedback was wrong?**  
A: Update the roadmap with what you learned. But the feedback about dishonest claims was correct.

**Good luck. Be honest. Build great things.** 🚀
