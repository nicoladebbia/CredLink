# Phase 47: Objection One-Liners

## "We already watermark."
**Answer**: Watermarks ≠ provenance; peer-reviewed work shows image/text watermarks are fragile and can be removed or paraphrased away. C2PA records signed provenance; remote manifests survive optimizers.
**Proof**: arXiv research on watermark fragility

## "We have CAI already."
**Answer**: Great—CAI Verify is where we point proofs. Our wedge is survival: remote manifests + Link header keep credentials intact through hostile pipelines, while embeds get stripped.
**Proof**: verify.contentauthenticity.org

## "No compliance need."
**Answer**: EU AI Act Article 50: disclose AI-generated/altered content. Your creatives and vendor feeds will need traceable disclosure; our logs + badge make that audit-ready.
**Proof**: Artificial Intelligence Act Article 50

## "Key custody risk."
**Answer**: We use per-tenant keys and publish compliance packs with CAI-verifiable manifests; OEMs and CDNs are standardizing on Content Credentials—buyers expect this.
**Proof**: Content Authenticity Initiative standards

## "Too complex to implement."
**Answer**: One line of code adds the Link header; WordPress/Shopify plugins auto-inject. Your existing CDN can serve remote manifests without touching your CMS.
**Proof**: Cloudflare Workers implementation examples

## "We don't have technical resources."
**Answer**: Managed service option: we host manifests, you add one DNS record. Pilot includes setup and weekly survival reports.
**Proof**: Pilot case studies with non-technical teams
