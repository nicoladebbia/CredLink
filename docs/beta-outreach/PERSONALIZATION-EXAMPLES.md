## Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Newsroom

**❌ Generic (Bad):**
```
Hi John,

We're building an image authenticity API. Your team at New York Times 
handles photos and might benefit from this.

Interested in beta access?
```

**✅ Personalized (Good):**
```
Hi John,

I saw NYT recently launched a fact-checking initiative around 
manipulated images in breaking news. 

CredLink could help verify photo authenticity using C2PA cryptographic 
proofs - even after compression and social media sharing.

We're looking for 5 newsrooms for beta testing. Interested?
```

**Why it's better:**
- References specific initiative
- Shows research
- Explains specific benefit
- Creates urgency (only 5 spots)

### Example 2: E-commerce

**❌ Generic (Bad):**
```
Hi Jennifer,

We built an API for image verification. Shopify could use this 
for product photos.

Want to learn more?
```

**✅ Personalized (Good):**
```
Hi Jennifer,

Congrats on Shopify's recent seller verification features launch!

One gap we've seen: verifying product photos are authentic. Sellers 
often steal photos from competitors, leading to "not as described" 
returns.

CredLink cryptographically signs product photos so buyers can verify 
authenticity. We're looking for 3 e-commerce platforms for beta.

Worth exploring?
```

**Why it's better:**
- Congratulates recent launch
- Identifies specific pain point
- Quantifies opportunity (reduce returns)
- Creates scarcity (only 3 spots)

---

### Example 3: Real Estate

**❌ Generic (Bad):**
```
Hi Christopher,

We have a solution for verifying property photos. Zillow might 
find this useful.

Let me know if interested.
```

**✅ Personalized (Good):**
```
Hi Christopher,

I noticed Zillow's recent focus on listing quality and buyer 
protection. One challenge: ensuring property photos are current 
and haven't been manipulated.

CredLink embeds cryptographic proofs in photos with timestamp, 
location, and original state verification. The proof survives 
MLS processing and website optimization.

We're testing with 4 real estate platforms. Interested?
```

**Why it's better:**
- References company initiative
- Identifies specific challenge
- Explains technical solution
- Shows it works with their stack
