# Phase 47: Email & LinkedIn Scripts

## First Touch (Newsroom Photo Lead)

**Subject**: Your images likely lose Content Credentials in delivery

**Body**: 
Your images likely lose Content Credentials in delivery. Here's a 45-sec clip where the same JPEG fails with embed, passes with remote Link (C2PA §15.5). Want us to run a 60-second survival check on any article URL and send you CAI Verify links + a fix playbook?

**Reference**: C2PA Specification §15.5

## EU Brand/Agency

**Subject**: Article 50 disclosure for AI-altered creatives

**Body**:
Article 50 requires disclosure for AI-altered creatives. We wire that disclosure into your media via Content Credentials and a remote manifest so optimizers can't break it. 14-day pilot—200 assets, weekly survival stats, CAI Verify links.

**Reference**: Artificial Intelligence Act Article 50

## Marketplace Trust Lead

**Subject**: Stop returns from misattribution

**Body**:
Returns from misattribution cost real money. We add verifiable provenance to listing images (remote manifest + badge). One snippet, and your top 50 listings will show CAI-verifiable history by Friday.

## LinkedIn Post Template

**Hook**: 3 ways your images lose provenance (and 1 that survives)

**Body**: 
Same JPEG, 3 delivery paths:
❌ Strip optimizer → metadata gone
⚠️ Preserve embed → intermittent failure  
✅ Remote manifest → 99.9% survival

C2PA spec mandates Link header discovery. We add it, your CDN serves it, CAI Verify confirms it live. 60-second survival check for any URL in comments.
