- Decision date within 30 days
- Stack compatibility verified

**Measurement**: CRM count = 10 meetings
**Timeline**: Within 2 weeks of playbook launch
**Status**: ❌ PASS | ✅ FAIL

- Value owner assigned
- Survival baseline established

**Playbook Elements Used**:
- Demo microsite tiles clicked
- 45-second clip viewed

## Test 3: Resistant Lead Conversion
**Criteria**: One resistant lead closed after objections deck
**Resistance Types**:
- "We already watermark" → arXiv proof on fragility

- "No compliance need" → AI Act Article 50 requirements
- "Key custody risk" → per-tenant key architecture

**Closing Sequence**:
1. Objection presented → Specific proof deployed
2. Technical concerns addressed → Implementation simplified
3. Budget objections → ROI calculator with compliance costs
4. Security questions → Compliance pack with CAI verification

**Proof Points Required**:
- C2PA specification quotes (3+ references)
- arXiv research citations (3+ papers)
- Technology Watch industry analysis (3+ reports)
- Cloudflare implementation examples (3+ case studies)

**Measurement**: Closed deal = 1
**Timeline**: Within 30 days of initial objection
**Status**: ❌ PASS | ✅ FAIL
