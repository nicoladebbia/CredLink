# Demo Status Report

**Status:** BROKEN (Backend not implemented)  
**Last Updated:** 2024-11-09  
**Next Review:** After Phase 3 completion

## Current State:

### What You'll See:
- ✅ Gallery page renders
- ✅ Upload UI displays  
- ✅ Buttons are clickable
- ✅ Layout is responsive

### What Happens When You Click "Sign":
1. JavaScript makes POST request to /sign
2. Request fails: 404 or connection refused
3. Error appears in console
4. Nothing works

**This is expected. Backend doesn't exist yet.**

## Why Not Remove Demo?

Because:
1. Shows intended UX (once backend exists)
2. Frontend code is valid
3. Developers can see UI direction
4. Will work after Phase 3

**We're honest about what works and what doesn't.**

## Timeline to Working Demo:

- Phase 1 (Honesty): 2-3 days ← IN PROGRESS
- Phase 2 (Rebrand): 3-5 days
- Phase 3 (Backend): 4-8 weeks

**Estimate:** 8-10 weeks until demo actually works.
