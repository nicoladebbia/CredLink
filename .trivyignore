# Trivy ignore file for CVE scanning
# Only Critical and High vulnerabilities will fail the build
# Medium and Low can be ignored for release gates

# Example format (uncomment and modify as needed):
# CVE-2021-1234 # Medium vulnerability in dev dependency only
# CVE-2022-5678 # False positive, not applicable to our usage

# No current ignores - all Critical/High vulnerabilities must be addressed
