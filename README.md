# ⚠️ CRITICAL: PROJECT STATUS - READ THIS FIRST

**This is a research/architecture project. The backend does NOT exist.**

## What DOESN'T Work (Yet):
- ❌ Backend signing service (not implemented)
- ❌ POST /sign endpoint (returns 404)
- ❌ POST /verify endpoint (returns 404)  
- ❌ Demo (will fail on button click)
- ❌ CLI signing commands (no backend to connect to)
- ❌ All "production ready" claims (false)

## What DOES Work:
- ✅ Policy engine tests (`pnpm test:acceptance`)
- ✅ Frontend UI (visual/mock only)
- ✅ Architecture documentation
- ✅ Project structure

## Honest Timeline:
- **Phase 1-2 (Honesty + Rebrand):** 1-2 weeks → Currently in progress
- **Phase 3 (Backend Build):** 4-8 weeks → Not started
- **Phase 4 (Infrastructure Deploy):** 4-8 weeks → Not started  
- **Phase 5 (Customer Validation):** 12-16 weeks → Not started
- **Full Production Ready:** 6-12 months minimum

## Current Score: 3.5/10
- Documentation honesty: 3/10 (dishonest claims present)
- Code quality: 7/10 (good architecture, no implementation)
- Completeness: 1/10 (backend missing)
- Production readiness: 0/10 (nothing deployed)

**We are committed to radical transparency. All claims will be measured and proven before stated.**

# CredLink: C2PA Remote-First Architecture

**Project Type:** Commercial Product (In Development)  
**Status:** Backend not implemented (0% complete)  
**Timeline:** 6-12 months to production-ready system  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Honesty Audit (In Progress)

*Building production C2PA content authenticity platform. Not production ready yet.*

See [COMMERCIAL-ROADMAP.md](COMMERCIAL-ROADMAP.md) for full 18-30 month roadmap.

**Research goal:** Explore if remote-first C2PA architecture can achieve high survival rates for content authenticity across hostile internet infrastructure.

**Currently researching:** Whether cryptographic proofs can survive CDN optimization, sharing, and compression when stored remotely rather than embedded.

CredLink is a content authenticity platform that attaches cryptographic proof to images, proving they're genuine—even after 1,000 shares, compression, and CDN optimization. Works for newsrooms fighting deepfakes, e-commerce reducing chargebacks, brands proving compliance, and anyone who needs to prove an image is real.

---

## The Problem (Why This Exists)

- **Deepfakes are mainstream**: 14M created in 2023, growing 300% YoY. Anyone can fake anything.
- **Trust is broken**: 64% of people can't tell real from fake photos.
- **Current solutions fail**: Adobe Verify, Truepic, and others require both parties to use their tool—or the proof disappears when the image is shared, compressed, or optimized by a CDN.
- **Regulatory pressure**: EU AI Act now requires you to document image origins and prove they're authentic.
- **Economic impact**: Counterfeit product photos cost e-commerce $4.2T annually in losses + disputes.

**The hard truth**: There is no mainstream way to prove an image is real at scale.

---

## How CredLink Works (3-Step Flow)

### 1️⃣ **Sign Your Image**
```
Upload image → CredLink creates digital proof → Get manifest URL
```
- You upload an image (or just provide a URL)
- CredLink generates a cryptographic signature proving:
  - Who created this image? (creator ID)
  - When was it created? (timestamp)
  - What camera/tool was used? (device info)
  - How was it edited? (edit history)
- Returns a manifest URL you can store or embed

### 2️⃣ **Share It Anywhere**
```
Your image circulates: shared, compressed, optimized by CDNs
CredLink's architecture aims for high survival rates (target: >95%)
Note: Not measured yet - backend doesn't exist
```
Unlike competitors, our **remote-first architecture** means:
- Proof lives on Cloudflare's edge network (globally distributed, <50ms latency)
- Works even if recipient doesn't use CredLink
- Survives JPEG quality reduction, format conversion, CDN optimization, file compression

### 3️⃣ **Viewers Verify**
```
Viewer sees image → Clicks "Verify" button → Sees proof it's real
```
- One-click verification in any browser
- Shows: ✓ This is authentic ✓ Created by X on date Y ✓ Edit history
- Shows: ❌ This is NOT verified (deepfake/unverified)

---

## Who Should Use CredLink

| Audience | Problem CredLink Solves | Benefit |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Newsrooms** | Readers doubt your photos because deepfakes exist | Prove your journalism is real. Competitive advantage. Reader trust. |
| **E-commerce** | Sellers upload fake product photos → chargebacks | Reduce disputes 20-30%. Proof matches reality. Fewer refunds. |
| **Brands** | Competitors fake your marketing images | Prove authenticity. EU AI Act compliance. Document your content origins. |
| **Marketplaces** | Counterfeit goods destroy trust | Verify seller photos. Reduce liability. Cut chargeback costs. |
| **Developers** | You need to add authenticity to your platform | Simple REST API. 10 minutes to integrate. Works everywhere. |

## The Key Differentiator: Remote-First Architecture

## Competitor Comparisons

**Status:** Not available yet

We don't compare to competitors until we have:
1. ✅ Working backend (Phase 3)
2. ✅ Deployed infrastructure (Phase 4)
3. ✅ Measured survival rates (Phase 4)
4. ✅ Real customer validation (Phase 5)

**Timeline:** 6-8 months until fair comparison possible

**Previous mistake:** We had a comparison table comparing our architecture 
(not product) to shipping products. That was dishonest. We deleted it.

**What "high survival" means (target, not measured):** Remote proof designed to survive:
- ✓ JPEG quality reduction (Q75)
- ✓ Format conversion (JPG → WebP)
- ✓ CDN optimization (Imgix, Cloudinary, etc.)
- ✓ Shared 1,000+ times
- ✓ File compression
- ✓ Metadata stripping

Competitors fail because they embed proof in image metadata. CDNs strip it. We put proof on our edge network instead.

## Current Development Status

### ⚠️ **NOT Production Ready** - Development/Testing Only

---

## What Works Right Now

✅ **Acceptance Test Framework** - 16+ hostile-path scenarios testing CDN survival  
✅ **Policy Compiler** - Deterministic policy engine with remote-first doctrine  
✅ **Security Architecture** - HMAC signing, SSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation  
✅ **CLI Tool** - Basic C2PA signing and verification (development version)  
✅ **SDKs** - Python, Go, and JavaScript development SDKs  
✅ **Monorepo Structure** - pnpm workspaces with proper organization  
✅ **Development Sandboxes** - Test environments (strip-happy, preserve-embed, remote-only)

**These components are functional and tested.** You can run the test suite now.

## What It Will Look Like

⚠️ **Visual demos not yet available.**

**Expected user experience** (once built):

1. **Publisher signs image:**
   - Upload photo to CMS (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
   - CredLink auto-signs in background
   - Publisher gets manifest URL: `https://manifests.credlink.com/sha256:abc...`

2. **Image circulates the internet:**
   - Shared on social media 1,000+ times
   - Compressed by CDNs
   - Metadata stripped
   - **Proof survives** via manifest URL

3. **Viewer verifies authenticity:**
   - Sees verification badge on image
   - Clicks badge → modal opens
   - Shows: ✓ Creator, ✓ Timestamp, ✓ Edit history
   - Or shows: ❌ NOT VERIFIED (no proof found)

**Visual demos coming soon:**
- 📹 30-second GIF of full flow
- 📸 Badge on product page
- 📸 Verification modal
- 📸 Admin dashboard

For now, see [Component Status Table](#implementation-status) for what's actually built.

## Architecture: How It Actually Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CREDLINK SYSTEM                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. SIGNING LAYER (Your Image → Proof)
   ┌──────────────┐
   │ Your Image   │
   └──────┬───────┘
          │ Upload via API or plugin
          ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Rust C2PA Signer         │  ← Signs with cryptographic key
   │ (production-grade)       │     Generates C2PA manifest
   └──────┬───────────────────┘
          │ manifest.cbor (signed metadata)
          ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Cloudflare R2 Storage    │  ← Immutable, edge-distributed
   │ (hash-addressed)         │     Survives forever
   └──────┬───────────────────┘
          │ Returns: https://manifests.credlink.com/sha256:abc...
          ▼
   You get a manifest URL ← Share this with images

2. DELIVERY LAYER (Image Circulates)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Your image shared 1,000x                            │
   │ Compressed, optimized, CDN'd, metadata stripped...  │
   │ BUT: Manifest URL stays intact                      │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

3. VERIFICATION LAYER (Viewer Clicks "Verify")
   ┌──────────────┐
   │ Viewer sees  │
   │ image + URL  │
   └──────┬───────┘
          │ Browser makes request to manifest URL
          ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Cloudflare Edge Worker   │  ← Injects Link header
   │ (policy enforcement)     │     Responds in <50ms globally
   └──────┬───────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ C2PA Verification        │  ← Checks cryptographic signature
   │ (client-side or server)  │     Validates: creator, timestamp, edits
   └──────┬───────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Verify Badge             │  ← Shows proof or "NOT VERIFIED"
   │ (Chrome, Safari, Edge)   │     Links to edit history
   └──────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Architecture Wins

1. **Remote-First**: Proof lives on Cloudflare edge, not in image metadata
   - CDNs can't strip what's not in the file
   - Works globally with <50ms latency

2. **Immutable**: Manifests are hash-addressed, never change
   - Once signed, proof can't be tampered with
   - New content gets new hash

3. **No Network Effect**: Doesn't require both parties on platform
   - Viewer doesn't need CredLink account
   - Works with any image URL

4. **Standards-Based**: Uses C2PA (Content Credentials)
   - Industry standard backed by Adobe, Google, Twitter
   - Future-proof

## What Gets Tested (Hostile-Path Matrix)

We don't trust CDNs. We test real-world hostile scenarios:

| Scenario | What Happens | Remote Survives? | Embed Survives? |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **IMG_JPEG_Q75_STRIP** | Aggressive quality reduction | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |
| **IMG_CONVERT_WEBP** | Format conversion to WebP | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |
| **IMG_PRESERVE_EMBED_NOP** | Careful handling (preserve-embed sandbox) | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **REMOTE_ONLY_BASELINE** | Strict remote-only policy | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |
| **CDN_METADATA_STRIP** | Imgix/Cloudinary optimization | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |

**The data is brutal**: Embedded proof dies in hostile environments. Remote proof survives everything.

See `/docs/hostile-path-matrix.yaml` for all 16+ scenarios.

## Core Principles (Read This If You Fork)

1. **Remote-First by Default**
   - All public images require hash-addressed remote manifests
   - Embed is "advisory" only (nice-to-have, not required)

2. **Hostile Optimizer Assumption**
   - CDNs and optimizers strip metadata until proven otherwise
   - Default behavior: assume worst-case

3. **Manifest Immutability**
   - Once published, manifests never change
   - New content = new hash-addressed manifest

4. **Provenance ≠ Truth**
   - We verify technical authenticity, not factual accuracy
   - We don't detect deepfakes—we prove legitimate images
   - Abuse policies and legal framework separate

5. **Ruthless Survival Targets**
   - Remote survival: ≥ 99.9% (target, not measured yet)
   - Response time: < 600ms p95
   - Uptime: 99.9% (target SLA for Phase 5+)

---

## Pricing

**Not available yet.** Pricing will be determined after:
1. Backend implementation (Phase 3)
2. Infrastructure deployment (Phase 4)  
3. Actual cost measurement (Phase 4)
4. Customer validation (Phase 5)

**Honest timeline for pricing:** 6-8 months minimum.

**Previous pricing ($199/$699/$2,499):** Made up. Removed. See APOLOGY.md (to be created).

---

## How to Actually Use This (Current State)

### What You Can Do Right Now:

1. **Run Architecture Tests:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm test:acceptance
   ```
   This tests the policy engine architecture (no backend needed).

2. **Explore the Frontend UI:**
   ```bash
   cd demo
   open gallery.html  # View in browser
   ```
   This shows the UI mockup only. Clicking "Sign" will error.

3. **Read the Architecture:**
   - See `/docs/` for architecture documentation
   - See `/docs/roadmap/` for honest development timeline

### What You CANNOT Do:
- ❌ Sign images (backend doesn't exist)
- ❌ Verify signatures (backend doesn't exist)
- ❌ Deploy to production (nothing to deploy)
- ❌ Use in production (not ready, unsafe)

### When Will It Work?

See [docs/roadmap/ROADMAP-OVERVIEW.md](docs/roadmap/ROADMAP-OVERVIEW.md) for detailed timeline.

**Shortest realistic path:** 6-12 months to production-ready system.

---

## Honest Development Timeline

We're building this properly, with no shortcuts:
- **Phase 1-2:** Honesty + Rebrand (2 weeks) ← **IN PROGRESS**
- **Phase 3:** Backend Implementation (4-8 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Infrastructure Deployment (4-8 weeks)  
- **Phase 5:** Customer Validation (12-16 weeks)
- **Phase 6-10:** Enterprise Features & Excellence (12-18 months)

**Total: 18-30 months to world-class product.**

See full roadmap: [COMMERCIAL-ROADMAP.md](COMMERCIAL-ROADMAP.md)

## Installation & Deployment

### Development (What Actually Works)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run acceptance tests (this works!)
pnpm test:acceptance

# View test results
open .artifacts/acceptance/report.html
```

### Production Deployment

⚠️ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The following deployment methods are **planned but not functional yet**:

**Planned: Self-Hosted**
```bash
# NOT YET WORKING
# Future: docker build -f Dockerfile -t credlink:latest .
# Future: terraform apply in /infra/terraform/
```

**Planned: Cloudflare**
```bash
# NOT YET WORKING
# Future: wrangler publish
# Future: wrangler secret put HMAC_SECRET
```

**Timeline**: No production deployment date set yet

---

## Configuration (Planned)

⚠️ **Most configuration options are not implemented yet.**

### Planned: Environment Variables
```bash
# NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
# Future configuration:
REMOTE_ONLY=1                          # Force remote manifests
PRESERVE_PATHS=/media/preserve/        # Paths allowing embeds
MANIFEST_BASE=https://manifests.credlink.com

HMAC_SECRET=your-256-bit-key          # Log signing secret
KMS_KEY_ID=arn:aws:kms:...            # Key encryption

CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
R2_BUCKET=credlink-manifests
```

### Planned: Policy Configuration
```json
// NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
// Future policy config:
{
  "remote_only": true,
  "preserve_paths": ["/media/preserve/"],
  "drop_if_link_missing": false,
  "break_glass_hosts": [],
  "allowed_ai_signers": ["openai", "anthropic", "midjourney"]
}
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics (What We Track)
```
Remote Survival Rate    → % of scenarios with successful manifest resolution
Embed Survival Rate     → Embed survival in preserve-embed environment
Hash Alignment Rate     → Successful manifest content verification
Response Latency        → End-to-end verification timing (target: <600ms p95)
Uptime                  → System availability (target: 99.9%)
```

### Structured Logs (All Signed)
```json
{
  "ts": "2025-11-06T14:05:21.123Z",
  "tenant_id": "newsroom-123",
  "asset_id": "sha256:abc123...",
  "manifest_hash": "sha256:def456...",
  "scenario_id": "IMG_JPEG_Q75_STRIP",
  "policy": "remote-only",
  "verdict": {
    "remote_survives": true,
    "embed_survives": false,
    "latency_ms": 245
  },
  "sig": "HMAC-SHA256(...)"
}
```

### Alerts (Planned for Phase 4+)
- **CRITICAL**: Remote survival < 99.9% target
- **WARNING**: Embed survival < 95% target
- **INFO**: Latency degradation or system health

---

## Security & Legal

### Threat Model (What We Defend Against)
| Threat | How We Stop It |
|--------|----------------|
| Cache Poisoning | Hash alignment verification |
| Header Stripping | Remote manifest fallback |
| Manifest Tampering | Immutable R2 storage, cryptographic signatures |
| Policy Bypass | CSP headers, audit logging, break-glass auditing |

### Data Retention
- **Logs**: 24 months (compliance requirement)
- **Manifests**: Forever (content never changes)
- **User data**: Deleted on request (GDPR compliant)

### Legal Framework
See `/legal/`:
- `terms-of-service.md` — Usage rights
- `privacy-policy.md` — Data handling
- `abuse-policy.md` — Prohibited uses (deepfakes, misinformation, revenge porn, etc.)
- `break-glass-protocol.md` — Emergency overrides

No. We don't use AI to detect fakes. Instead, we attach proof showing "This image was created by Person X on Date Y." If someone creates a deepfake, it won't have this proof. Users see "NOT VERIFIED" and know to be suspicious.

### "Why should companies use this?"
Three reasons:
1. **Regulatory**: EU AI Act requires image provenance
2. **Revenue**: Fewer chargebacks on verified photos = more profit
3. **Trust**: Customers trust you more when you prove authenticity

### "Can people fake the proof?"
No. We use HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signatures (same tech banks use). Faking them requires breaking military-grade encryption—mathematically impossible.

### "What if someone's offline?"
Proof is embedded in image metadata. Offline, they see "Created by John Smith on Jan 1, 2025." They just can't verify it's legitimate without internet.

### "How is this different from blockchain?"
Blockchain requires everyone on the same chain. We use Cloudflare's edge network (already serving 60% of internet traffic). No blockchain needed, works everywhere.
