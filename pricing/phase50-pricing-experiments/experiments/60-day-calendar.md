    const triggeredRollbacks = [];
    
    for (const [metric, config] of Object.entries(this.rollbackTriggers)) {
      if (currentMetrics[metric] < config.threshold) {
        const procedure = this.rollbackProcedures[config.action];
        const result = await procedure.call(this, metric, currentMetrics[metric]);
        
        triggeredRollbacks.push({
          metric,
          currentValue: currentMetrics[metric],
          threshold: config.threshold,
          action: config.action,
          result
        });
      }
    }
    
    return triggeredRollbacks;
  }
  
  async immediateRollback(metric, currentValue) {
    // Immediately stop all experiments
    await this.stopAllExperiments();
    
    // Revert to original pricing
    await this.revertToOriginalPricing();
    
    // Notify all stakeholders
    await this.sendEmergencyNotification(metric, currentValue);
