## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are PLANNED pricing structures

## When Will Pricing Be Available?

**Timeline:**
1. **Phase 3:** Backend Implementation (4-8 weeks) - Measure actual costs
2. **Phase 4:** Infrastructure Deployment (4-8 weeks) - Measure performance
3. **Phase 5:** Customer Validation (12-16 weeks) - Test willingness to pay
4. **Phase 5:** Announce Pricing - Based on real data

**Earliest pricing announcement:** 6-8 months from now (2024-11-09)

## What We'll Base Pricing On:

1. **Actual infrastructure costs** (measured in Phase 4)
2. **Customer willingness to pay** (validated in Phase 5)
3. **Competitor pricing** (fair comparison after we ship)
4. **Value delivered** (proven with real customers)
