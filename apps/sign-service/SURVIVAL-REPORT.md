## Failure Analysis

### Common Failure Reasons

1. **Manifest Not Found** (45%)
   - Aggressive compression destroyed metadata
   - Primarily in extreme severity platforms

2. **Signature Invalid** (30%)
   - Format conversion issues
   - HEIF conversion most problematic

3. **Low Confidence** (20%)
   - Partial metadata preservation
   - Quality degradation

4. **Processing Error** (5%)
   - Transformation failures
   - Rare edge cases
