# Project Identity: The Choice That Must Be Made

**Status:** UNDECIDED - You're pretending to be both, which is dishonest  
**Decision Required:** Within 48 hours  
**Decision Maker:** Project owner/founder

---

## The Problem:

You're currently doing NEITHER of these honestly:

### Option A: Research/Open Source Project ✅ HONEST PATH

**What this means:**
- Focus on architecture exploration
- Share learnings via papers, blog posts, talks
- No commercial pressure
- No fake pricing/customers  
- Timeline: Indefinite (it's research)
- Success metric: Knowledge gained, papers published
- Positioning: "Exploring remote-first C2PA architecture"

**Required changes if you choose this:**
- ❌ Delete `/pricing/` directory entirely
- ❌ Delete `/legal/contracts/` (no customers, no contracts)
- ❌ Remove all pricing references from docs
- ❌ Remove "customer" and "enterprise" language
- ✅ Add "For Research Only" disclaimers
- ✅ Update README: "Academic/Research Project"  
- ✅ GitHub topics: +research, +academic, +c2pa, -production
- ✅ Focus docs on learnings, not features

**Pros:**
- Honest positioning
- No pressure to monetize
- Can take time exploring
- Academic credibility

**Cons:**
- No revenue (unless grants/sponsorship)
- Lower urgency to complete
- May not build full product

### Option B: Commercial Product ✅ HONEST PATH

**What this means:**
- Commit to building production-ready system
- 18-30 month journey to profitability
- Get real customers, earn real revenue
- Build team, raise funding (optional)
- Success metric: Revenue, customers, impact
- Positioning: "Building production authenticity platform"

**Required changes if you choose this:**
- ✅ Keep pricing structure (but mark as "planned, not available yet")
- ✅ Keep legal/contracts (will need when customers come)
- ✅ Update README: "In Development - Production timeline: 6-12 months"
- ❌ Remove "production ready" claims (not ready yet)
- ❌ Remove "try it now" CTAs (nothing to try yet)
- ✅ Add honest roadmap with Phase 1-10
- ✅ GitHub topics: +c2pa, +content-authenticity, +in-development
- ✅ Create COMMERCIAL-ROADMAP.md

**Pros:**
- Can build real business  
- Revenue potential
- Customer validation
- Market impact

**Cons:**
- Requires 18-30 months of disciplined work
- Need to build team
- Need to find customers
- Financial pressure

---

### Option C: Current State ❌ DISHONEST PATH

**What you're doing now (DON'T DO THIS):**
- Pretending backend exists (it doesn't)
- Showing pricing for vaporware
- Comparing to real products (you're not real yet)  
- Claiming "production ready" (false)
- Having customer language but no customers
- Research-level completeness with commercial promises

**This is the WORST option. It's dishonest and destroys trust.**
